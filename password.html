  <!-- This creates a box (container) that holds all the things we need for the password checker -->
  <h2>Ame Password Checker</h2>
  <!-- This is a heading that says "Ame Password Checker" in bigger letters at the top -->
  
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="password.css">
  <!-- This line tells the web page to look for a file called 'password.css'. This file makes the password checker look pretty and styled (like colors and spacing). -->

      <input type="password" placeholder=" Password" id="YourPassword">
      <!-- This is the box where the user types in their password. 
           'type="password"' means the password will be hidden (like dots or stars instead of letters).
           'placeholder=" Password"' means the word "Password" shows up inside the box until you start typing.
           'id="YourPassword"' gives this box a special name so we can find it easily in our code. -->

      <!-- This creates an empty box that can be filled later. We'll use this to show things, like the password strength message. -->

  <div class="strengthMeter"></div>
  <!-- This creates another empty box for the strength meter. The strength meter is like a bar that will fill up when the password is stronger. -->
